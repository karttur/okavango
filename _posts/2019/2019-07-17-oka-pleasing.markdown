In this post I briefly discuss the data I used when studying the Okavango Delta, Botswana as a Post Doc with University of the Witwatersrand 1999 to 2001.

## Landsat images

At the time of my Post Doc, 1991 - 2002, Landsat images were not available for free but carried a rather hefty price tag. We could not afford to purchase any images. Through contacts with Anglo American my supervisor, Professor T.S. McCarthy, we got a set of cloud free Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images that covered the Okavango, table 1 and figure 1.

scene		date of acquisiton
174_073		Aug 1st 1994

When we started the projects on the Okavango in 1999, the signals from the Global Positioning System (GPS) were purposefully degraded and had an accuracy of around 100 m. The Landsat data that we used thus had rather large geometeric errors. As several of my studies used the four landsat scenes shown in the figure above, all maps resulting from these studies are plagued by geometric errors. The theoretical geometric error compared to orthorectified aerial photo maps were estimated to about 50 m. The orthorectified photos, however, were also not correct inside the vast wetlands.

### The pleasing Landsat composite

As part of the Okavango project, I created a natural color composite of the 4 landsat scenes. This "pleasning" map was then used as backdrop for many publications highlighting different structures and phenomena in and around the Okavango.

The pleasing landsat composite is available as a 3-band (red-green-blue) GeoTiff image. The downloadable GeoTiff is projected to UTM34S (EPSG:32734).

## ATSR images

For tracing the flooding pattern we used a series of ATSR images.
