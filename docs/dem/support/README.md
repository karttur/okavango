# Topographic regionalization of the Okavango Delta, Botswana

This folder contains spatial data layers of fault lines, river channels and elevation regionalizations of the Okavango
region, Botswana. The data are projected to UTM 34 south (EPSG:32734).

Details on the regionalization data are available in the post [Regional topography](https://karttur.github.io/okavango/blog/oka-dem/).

The regionalization data were manually fixed in July 2019; the fault lines where updated and labels added, the river dataset was not updates but the regional layer was cleaned and the sub-regions joined to multi-polygons. Details of the data organizations are available in the post [Okavango spatial data organization](https://karttur.github.io/okavango/article/oka-datafix/).
