# Landsat satellite image data of the Okavango Delta, Botswana

This folder contains a single map (image) in zip format. The image is a Landsat natural color (pleasing) Geotiff of the Okavango region in Botswana at 28.5 m spatial resolution and projected to UTM 34 south (EPSG:32734). The image is in byte format and created from a dithered red-green-blue (RGB) composite that in turn was constructed using a Brovey transformation.

Details on the image are available in the post [Landsat satellite image data](https://karttur.github.io/okavango/blog/oka-landsat/).
